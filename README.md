# Trivial Neural Network
An example of a trivial neural network. I explore the concepts of forward propagation, a loss function (MSE), backpropagation, optimization, and convergence.

# Example
Suppose we want to build and train a neural network to draw a line. The network must learn the correct values of (w) and (b) that align with the given data points.
